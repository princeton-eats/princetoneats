            You’re rushing out of COS 333 at 1:20 PM, stomach growling, with just over an hour before your next class.
            You need to grab lunch, but there’s a problem—your dietary restrictions mean you can’t just walk into any dining
            hall and eat anything available. Princeton Dining’s website has the info, but sifting through menus for all seven halls?
            That’s time you don’t have, and you are NOT the only one who feels that way. It’s so many of us out here.
            That’s where Princeton Eats comes in, your personal dining meal recommend. In seconds, it scans every dining hall menu,
            filters meals based on your preferences—vegan, halal, gluten-free, nut-free, you name it—and tells you exactly where to go
            for a meal that fits your needs.
